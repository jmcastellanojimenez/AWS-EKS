## Recommendations

### For Failed Tests
1. Review and update relevant steering documents
2. Add missing information or clarify existing content
3. Ensure cross-document consistency
4. Re-run tests after updates

### For Continuous Improvement
1. Run tests weekly to validate steering document effectiveness
2. Add new tests based on operational experience
3. Update validation criteria as platform evolves
4. Monitor pass rates over time to track improvement

## Next Steps
1. Address any failed tests by updating steering documents
2. Validate fixes by re-running specific tests
3. Schedule regular testing to maintain context quality
4. Expand test coverage based on operational needs
